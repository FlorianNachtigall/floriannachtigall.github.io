## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the Technical University of Berlin. My research focuses on how machine learning techniques can advance and scale-up the decarbonization of the transport and building sector. Methodologically, I'm particularly intersted in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling spatial relationships and causal machine learning for estimating the effect of urban form and transport policy-related intenversions.
I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Felix Creutzig and affiliated with the Mercator Research Institute for Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC), where we aim to support data-driven solutions for low-carbon urban planning using geospatial data and machine learning as part of the [AI4UP](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/landnutzung-infrastruktur-und-transport/ai4up.html) project.


## Open Source Software

- **[gtfs2nx](https://github.com/ai4up/gtfs2nx):** A Python package to convert [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) feeds to realistic, routable [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) graph.
- **[slurm-pipeline](https://github.com/ai4up/slurm-pipeline):** A thin Python wrapper for resilient and scalable [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) job scheduling.
