## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the Technical University of Berlin. My research focuses on how machine learning techniques can advance and scale-up the decarbonization of the transport and building sector. Methodologically, I'm intersted in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling spatial relationships and causal machine learning for estimating the effect of transport-related policy and urban form intenversions.

I am supervised by [Prof. Dr. Felix Creutzig](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/about/team/creutzig-felix.html) and affiliated with the Mercator Research Institute for Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC), where we aim to support data-driven solutions for low-carbon urban planning using geospatial data and machine learning as part of the [AI4UP](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/landnutzung-infrastruktur-und-transport/ai4up.html) project.
